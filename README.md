In-game rules:

1. Do not do anything harmful in chat - This is just common sense. It includes spam, racism, advertising etc.
2. Be respectful towards everybody - This includes all players and staff members.
3. Do not use any disallowed modification - Visit https://github.com/Neptunity/Allowed-Client-Mods or our discord (https://discord.neptunity.land) for more info.
4. Teaming in any solo mode is bannable.
5. Have fun!

Punishment info:

For chat offenses in 90% of cases, some sort of mute will be the punishment.

For disallowed client modifications, punishment may vary, anti-cheat bans are always 7 days long while bans created by staff members may last longer.

We are allowed to change this any time!

These changes take effect on 𝐉𝐮𝐧𝐞 𝟏𝟖, 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟏.
Not knowing these rules does not mean that you are free from them!
